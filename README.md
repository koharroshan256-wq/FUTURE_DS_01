Task 01 : Sales Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, and Business insights

# 📊 Sales Data Analysis & Business Strategy

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is Task 1 of my data analytics internship. The objective was to take raw, unstructured sales data, clean it, calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and extract actionable business recommendations using Pivot Tables and Data Visualization.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Microsoft Excel:** Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Advanced Charting
* **Data Analysis:** Formatting, Handling Missing Values, KPI Calculation
* **Business Strategy:** Data-Driven Decision Making

## 📂 Files Included
* `Cleaned_Sales_Data.xlsx` - Contains the cleaned dataset, KPI summaries, Pivot Tables, and interactive charts.
* `Sales_Insights_and_Recommendations.xlsx` - Contains the final business findings and strategies.

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Total Revenue:** $244,385.00
* **Total Orders:** 200
* **Total Quantity Sold:** 1,160
* **Average Order Value (AOV):** $1,221.92

## 💡 Key Business Insights
1. **Regional Performance:** The North region generates the highest revenue ($80,924), significantly outperforming the West ($46,133).
2. **Category Dominance:** Electronics dominate sales, accounting for 78.2% of total revenue.
3. **Seasonality:** Sales see a massive peak in November ($36k), indicating strong holiday demand.
4. **Top Product:** Laptops are the single highest-grossing product ($133k).

## 🚀 Actionable Recommendations
* **Inventory Planning:** Increase Q4 stock orders for Laptops and Monitors by 20% starting in October to prevent holiday stockouts.
* **Ad Allocation:** Double down on regional marketing in the North to maximize ROI on an already high-performing audience.
* **Product Bundling:** Bundle high-selling Laptops with slow-moving Office Supplies at a 5% discount to clear inventory and increase average basket size.
