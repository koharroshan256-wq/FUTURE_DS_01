Task 01 : Sales Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, and Business insights

"For Task 1, I conducted an end-to-end sales data analysis. I took raw, messy sales data and cleaned it to ensure accuracy. Then, I built out Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and interactive visualizations using Pivot Tables to identify regional trends and product performance. Finally, I translated those numbers into actionable business recommendations to help the company increase revenue and optimize inventory."
